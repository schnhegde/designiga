      question: "What information do you need from clients to start a logo design project?",
      answer: "To create the perfect logo for your brand, I need to understand your business vision, target audience, brand personality, and any specific requirements you have. This includes your company name, industry, preferred colors, style preferences, and any existing brand guidelines. I also like to know about your competitors and what makes your business unique. The more context you provide, the better I can craft a logo that truly represents your brand."

    {
      question: "What is your design process for logo creation?",
      answer: "My design process follows a structured approach: 1) Discovery & Research - I analyze your brand, industry, and competitors. 2) Concept Development - I create multiple initial concepts and sketches. 3) Design & Refinement - I develop the strongest concepts digitally and refine them based on your feedback. 4) Finalization - I provide you with the final logo in various formats (PNG, SVG, EPS) and color variations. 5) Brand Guidelines - I deliver a comprehensive style guide for consistent brand usage."

    {
      question: "How many revisions are included in your logo design package?",
      answer: "I include up to 3 rounds of revisions in my standard logo design package. This ensures we can refine the design to perfectly match your vision while keeping the project timeline manageable. Each revision round includes feedback incorporation and design adjustments. If you need additional revisions beyond the included ones, we can discuss options for extended revision rounds."
    },
    {
      question: "What file formats will I receive with my final logo?",
      answer: "You'll receive your logo in multiple formats to ensure versatility across all applications: Vector formats (SVG, EPS, AI) for scalability, high-resolution PNG files with transparent backgrounds, JPG files for web use, and PDF files for print applications. I also provide different color variations including full color, black, white, and any specific color combinations you need for your brand."
